## Overview

During the last couple weeks at The Tech Academy we worked on developing a website that allowed users to create objects/items for a database, and also allowing them to edit or delete objects/items from the database using the MVC Django framework. During my two week sprint, using Azure DevOps, I would check the scrum board to see my assigned stories. We also implemented Agile and Scrum methodologies with sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospective meetings.

## CRUD Functionality

We were tasked with back-end stories, as well as front-end stories to style and build our structure for our apps. Below I have included some descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with some code snippets as well as snippets of the app.
